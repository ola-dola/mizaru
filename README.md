# Mizaru - See No Evil

> Browser extension to remove video suggestions from Youtube's home page.

---

## Why does this exist?

Youtube's home page is filled with video suggestions that could be distracting when you need to get serious work done. This extension removes that, leaving you with a clutter free home page.

It also removes links to 'Shorts', another addictive feature. So you're left with a minimalistic Youtube site perfect for work or study.

## Installation

The extension is currently under review on Chrome web store and is yet to be published. Follow the instructions below to manually install before the release:

- Click on the green "Code" button at the top of this repo page(the current page you're on).
- Click on "Download ZIP" to download the source files and extract the zip file once downloaded.
- Open Chrome browser and navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in a new tab.
- Click on "Load unpacked" button on the top left corner of the page.
- Select the folder extracted earlier and press "Enter" to continue.

You're now all set.

## FAQ

<b>Q: When will this be available on the Chrome web store?</b>

<b>A:</b> As soon as it is approved by the store.

<b>Q: What browsers are supported? </b>

<b>A:</b> Google's Chrome and any other Chromium-based browsers(Brave, Edge, etc.). Support for Safari and Firefox would be added later.

<b>Q: Why is this called 'Mizaru'? </b>
