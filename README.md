# Mizaru - See No Evil

> Browser extension to remove video suggestions from Youtube's home page.

---

## Why does this exist?

Youtube's home page is filled with video suggestions that could be distracting when you need to get serious work done. This extension removes that, leaving you with a clutter free home page.

It also removes links to 'Shorts', another addictive feature. So you're left with a minimalistic Youtube site perfect for work or study.

## Installation

Available for installation via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mizaru-see-no-evil/phddimbeaegcnfcjjemcbgpnohgonmjd)

## FAQ

<b>Q: What browsers are supported? </b>

<b>A:</b> Google's Chrome and any other Chromium-based browsers(Brave, Edge, etc.). Support for Safari and Firefox would be added later.

<b>Q: Why is this called 'Mizaru'? </b>

<b>A:</b> It's from the Japanese 'Three Wise Monkeys' pictoral maxim. Mizaru is the monkey who sees no evil, by covering his eyes.

I found that to be perfect as the icon for the extension, and decided to use the name.
