# Mizaru Extension Privacy Policy

## Intro

Different extensions use personal data in different ways. This privacy policy encompasses general principles of how extensions I create collect and handle personal data. Individual extensions, when you first use them, will display their own unique privacy policies and ask you to agree to them before continued use.

## Data Collection

This extension does not collect any data at all. Since no data is collected, it stands to reason, and is, indeed, the case, that none of your data can be sold to third parties.

That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If there are substantive<sup>1</sup> changes made to this privacy policy, I will push out a new version of the affected extension(s) and ask you to agree to the amended privacy policy.

## Feedback

If you have questions or concerns about this privacy policy, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:oredolaolamide@gmail.com) or [file an issue](https://github.com/ola-dola/mizaru/issues/new) to this repository.

#### Notes:

1 - When I say "substantive," I mean that I won't push out app updates for minor changes like fixing a typo.
